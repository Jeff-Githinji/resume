## Sensor Setup
To enhance the accuracy of your energy calculations, you can integrate energy sensors. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Purchase an Energy Sensor**: Obtain a compatible energy monitoring sensor (e.g., smart plugs or dedicated energy monitors) that can measure the power consumption of your appliances.
2. **Install the Sensor**: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the sensor. Typically, this involves plugging the sensor into an outlet and connecting your appliance to the sensor.
3. **Connect to the Application**: If your sensor supports API integration, you can connect it to the Energy Saving Calculator to fetch real-time data. Ensure you have the necessary API keys and permissions.
4. **Monitor Usage**: Use the sensor to monitor the energy usage of your appliances. The data can be used to input more accurate energy consumption values into the calculator.

## Usage
1. Enter your local electricity rate in the designated field.
2. Add appliances by selecting their type and entering their energy usage and daily usage duration.
3. If using sensors, input the real-time data collected from your sensors for more accurate calculations.
4. Click the "Calculate Total Savings" button to view your energy usage summary and potential savings.
5. Review the personalized insights and recommendations provided by the application.
